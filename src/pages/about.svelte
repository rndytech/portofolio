      Hi there! I'm Randi Ramli. My online alias was taken from my middle name
      without the first and last letter. My name is Dicha Zelianivan Arkana.
      I'm a 17 y/o Asian boi who loves to build websites (or any software
      related things at this point) and contribute to any open source projects
      that I like.

    <p class="about__text">
      I've been learning web development since roughly around 2019. I understand
      the basic of HTML, CSS, and JS quite well. I'm still learning about
      React/Next, Svelte, and Typescript but felt quite comfortable enoguh to
      use them daily. I've been learning Lua and Golang recently.
      <span class="no">
        I was focusing on learning Rust previously but I decided to focus on
        Golang Instead. I still code Rust every now and then but just because I
        like it, not planning any exciting stuff with it.
      </span>
      I now want to do more serious stuff with Rust instead of Go, after using
      Go for a while, I think I prefer Rust ;)

      I live in a beautiful country called Indonesia. I can speak Indonesian
      natively
      <span class="about__paren">(obviously)</span>, and English quite fluently.
      I am currently learning Japanese because I want to be able to speak a
      language that uses a different writing system.

      or Discord @elianiva#1558. Though I'm rarely active on those two. I only
      use Twitter to simp over Vtubers and retweet some arts that I like despite
      having no followers lmao. Reason why is I want to "save" them so I can
      just scroll through my profile and see some good arts. I barely use
      Discord. I just open it every now and then, that's about it. I am trying

        I'm that guy who easily gets obsessed with something that I found
        interesting. One of them is
        <a
          class="about__link"

          rel="norel noreferrer"
          href="https://www.youtube.com/user/BABYMETALofficial"
        >Babymetal</a>
        (check them out btw ãƒ„), I found them out around March 2020 and got
        instantly obsessed with them. They are the main reason why I decided to
        learn Japanese and appreciate Japanese culture :p Another one is Kill La
        Kill. I love this anime so much
        <span class="about__paren">(no, not because 2d anime tiddies)</span>
        that I want to learn to draw again and my website colour is heavily
        inspired from Senketsu and Junketsu.
      </p>
      <p class="about__text">
        I also love Vtubers. Before I watch them, I said to myself "why would I
        watch some random 2D anime character streaming on Youtube?" but here I
        am, ended up watching
        <i>a lot</i>
        of vtubers on my free time. It also helped me learn Japanese a bit.
      </p>
      <p class="about__text">
        Some weird thing about me is, I don't really like to discuss stuff that
        I like with other people (not all of them, I do enjoy talking about
        anime related stuff with my friends). I don't know why, I like some
        things better if I just enjoy it myself and not talk about it with other
        people.

      I made this website so I can post stuff that I learned and share it to
      other people. I also use this as a note to myself because believe it or
      not, I sometimes forgot stuff that I did. By having this website, I can
      just revisit what I've done in the past.

      I use Sapper and MDSveX to build this website and it's hosted on Vercel.

    <h1 class="about__heading">My Setup</h1>
    <p class="about__text">
      My laptop is Thinkpad X220. I use Linux as my Operating System.

        class="about__link"
        rel="norel noreferrer"
      >Archlinux</a>
      to be more specific. I've used Linux since around Q3 of 2019. I spent most
      of my time inside terminal and rest of it inside a browser or random GUI
      app. I prefer using my keyboard over my mouse everywhere if possible
      (except browsing the internet, mouse is way better)

      I use a Window Manager called

        rel="norel noreferrer"
      >Neovim</a>. I've been using it fulltime since around Q4 of 2019. It's
      actually my first text editor that I feel comfortable with and do
      something serious hence I can't relate when people say "VIM has a high
      learning curve" :p I started using it when I got my first laptop. After
      using it for quite a while my config is has grown quite a lot. It is now
      written in lua and is quite lengthy. I've written some post explaining
      some of my config if you're interested on that. Anyway, here's
