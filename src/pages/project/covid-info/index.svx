**Covid Info** is the first React app I made that uses a third party API as its data source. This app is also kinda buggy because when I made it, I don't really care about any other feature except the homepage that shows current covid data.

I'm planning on remaking this if I got time for it using Svelte.

**(01-05-2021) UPDATE:** I've made a remake for this using NextJS. I didn't choose Svelte because I want to explore more stuff about NextJS and I've done quite a bit of Svelte recently, so doing something different is nice. You can check it out [here](https://elianiva.me/project/covid-info-v2)
